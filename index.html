            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                If you had two different films, 44 years apart, how much do they differ? What do they have in common. Here’s an example, the films Parasite and Jaws. Both films use Marxist ideas to create underlying messages that critique their current eras. In this video we will be comparing how both Parasite and Jaws share certain themes that contribute to the overall narrative. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Marxism is a social, economic, and political philosophy. The premise of Marxism was to highlight the conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie are those who own most of the wealth and means of production. They contrast the proletariat by their wealth and political power. The bourgeoisie are linked to liberalism: the political ideology based on the rights of the individual. The proletariats are those who have nothing to offer, but their capacity to work. They are the working class. In Marxist philosophy, the proletariat is an exploited class under the conditions of capitalism. We can use this concept to uncover the hidden messages about power, class struggles, and inequality in films. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2019 film, Parasite, revolves around the Kim family. The family: Ki-Taek the father, Chung-Sook the mother, Ki-Woo the son, and Ki-Jung the daughter, they struggle to survive by working low-wage jobs while living in a bug-infested semi-basement. The protagonist, Ki-Woo is given an opportunity to tutor for an upper-class family, the Park family. Ki-Woo uses this opportunity to infiltrate the Park household by slowly integrating his family as employees of the Park family. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jaws 1975, a groundbreaking blockbuster, is not only celebrated for its innovative suspense, captivating storytelling, and cultural significance but also serves as a lens through which Marxist theory can be explored. The film's narrative and characters reflect the dynamics of class struggle, power, and labor, providing insight into the roles different groups and individuals occupy within the story. 
            </p>
            <p>
                First, let’s use psychoanalytic theory, specifically Sigmund’s structure to understand the artistic visions behind these two films. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Psychoanalytical theory is a framework that was developed by Sigmund Freud. The intention of the theory was to understand the human mind. We can use this concept to understand the subtle underlying messages that in hidden in each film.

                    <h2>Marxist Lens</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Parasite, the Kim family represents the proletariat. They offer labour or work in return for wages. The Kim family is in a financial struggle, due to the nature of low-income jobs, the Kim family struggles to pay rampant bills. The Kim family are also located on the poorer side of Seoul with unsanitary living conditions. The Kim family, out of options, are desperate to make money by any means necessary. It is this situation that leads them into being exploited for their labour. In the beginning of the film, the Kim family folds pizza boxes to earn money. One-fourth of their boxes were rejected due to quality issues. The pizza company exploits them by reducing ten percent of their pay. This penalty caused Mrs. Kim to complain about their pay deduction. While in an argument with one of the employees, Mrs. Kim says “So you’re really docking 10% off our pay?” “Our pay is so low already! How can you do this?” (Parasite 0:04:27-38). The employee responds, “This is not some minor issue. You know what one shitty box can do to our brand image?” (0:04:42-50). This portrays how the lives of the Kim family are considered inferior to those of the pizza company. Their well-being is worth less than the company’s brand. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the film, the Park family depicts the characteristics of the bourgeoisie. Mr. Park owns a computer company, his own means of production. From this company, the Park family gains tremendous wealth. They live in a mansion with a spacious backyard in an upper-class neighbourhood. The Park family is the embodiment of the bourgeoisie.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Park family views their employees—like the Kim family—as basic tools that maintain their lifestyles. During the rainstorm, both Park parents spend the night in the living room to supervise their son who is spending the night outdoors. Mr. Park complains about Mr. Kim’s distinct odor. He says that Mr. Kim never crosses the line, “but that smell crosses the line.” (1:28:05-10). He associates his smell with the poor by saying, “But you sometimes smell it on the subway.” (1:28:25-27). This reflects his disdain for the lower class, an ingrained perception of inferiority. When Mr. Park says, “People who ride the subway have a special smell” (Parasite 1:28:33-35), he unintentionally displays his dehumanizing view of people who rely on public transportation. Mr. Park’s prejudice reveals how capitalism creates class conflict.  And that is only one example of the Park’s family superiority complex. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar dynamic is displayed in three other scenes. In the first scene, Mrs. Park treats Kim Ki-jung as nothing more than a tool, saying, "You have to be here by one o’clock at the latest. And we’ll count today as a lesson" (Parasite 1:41:51-1:41:55). In the second example, Mr. Kim after having his home completely flooded, he’s lost a place for him and his family to stay. This forces him to sleep in a gymnasium. Later on, he overhears Mrs. Park discussing yesterday’s rain with complete disregard for his suffering, saying, “Did you see the sky today? Crystal clear. Zero air pollution. Rain washed it all away. Of course, camping was a major failure because of the rain, but we get to have a garden party instead, yay! It was actually a blessing in disguise” (Parasite 1:44:23-1:44:28). Mrs. Park is completely unaware of how the rain has affected other Koreans in the SAME CITY that she and her family lives. She even covers her nose and rolls down the window, implying his smell is unpleasant. Later, Mr. Kim is further humiliated when Mr. Park pays him to wear a humiliating costume and justifies it by saying, “Think of it as an extension of your work, okay?” (Parasite 1:48:08-1:48:10). There is never a point where the Park family sees the Kim family as human beings, instead, the Kim family is just another means to an end.

                    <h2>Psychoanalytical Lens</h2>
                    <p>
                    In Sigmund’s structure, the id, ego, and superego together form the psyche. However, people often lean more toward one aspect, like the id or the superego, depending on their personality.  
                    </p>
    
                    </p>
                    In Parasite, this dynamic is evident as different characters embody these traits to varying degrees. Ki-Taek, the father of the Kim family, serves as the film's representation of the id. He is frequently driven by carnal desires, seeking immediate gratification and succumbing to impulsive emotions like rage, sadness, and laziness. His rage is vividly illustrated in the climax, where he kills Mr. Park in a moment of unrestrained fury. His laziness and resignation are encapsulated in the scene at the gymnasium when he tells Ki-woo, “Ki-woo, you know what plan never fails? A ‘non-plan’” (Parasite 1:39:18–1:39:27). This statement reflects a mindset of defeat and apathy, suggesting that if failure is inevitable, it’s better not to plan for success at all. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    Parasite shows a balanced id and superego making the perfect character to be the representation of ego, Ki-woo the son of the Kim’s. His balanced psyche leads to Ki-woo being very strategic and quick minded throughout the film, as he gets his sister in, and is the only one to try and deal with Guen-Sae the basement dweller. This thinking is verbalized as in the scene where he doesn’t hesitate to mention his sister when Choi Yeon-gyo says “Maybe that’s why we’ve been through so many art teachers. And none of them could last a month” (Parasite 19:29-19:38). After this Ki-woo makes up a lie about his sister naming her Jessica and giving her a whole new background in a short span of a few seconds. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    The superego, which represents ethics, societal norms, and moral judgment, is portrayed through Choi Yeon-gyo, the mother of the Parks, and Dong-ik Park, the father. Both characters embody the superego by adhering to and overly relying on societal structures and values, particularly in their interactions with others. Their belief in these norms is evident in how they equate money with trust and respect. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    Dong-ik exemplifies this when he says to Ki-Taek, “Driver Kim. You know today is your workday. Think of this as an extension of your work, okay?” (Parasite 1:47:57–1:48:11). This statement highlights the transactional nature of their relationship, where respect and obligations are tied directly to financial compensation.
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    Similarly, Choi Yeon-gyo uses money as leverage when persuading Kim Ki-jung to attend Da-song's impromptu birthday party. She begins with, “Are you free for lunch today? We’re having an impromptu birthday for Da-song” (Parasite 1:41:32–1:41:38). When Ki-jung hesitates, Choi Yeon-gyo immediately offers reassurance through monetary incentive, adding, “And I’ll count today as one of your sessions. You know what I mean?” (Parasite 1:41:51–1:41:55). This interaction reflects her reliance on societal norms where wealth and influence maintain relationships and reinforce social hierarchies. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    While the characters in Parasite largely align with their respective representations of the psyche, they occasionally stray from these roles, revealing moments of complexity and contradiction. For example, Ki-woo demonstrates this when he kisses Da-hye, allowing his id to override his moral compass. This moment is driven by impulsive desire, showcasing a brief lapse in his usual calculated demeanor.
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    The Kims as a whole also display the ego at times, particularly as they adapt to their working conditions and navigate the societal structures imposed by their roles within the Park household. These moments highlight their ability to balance between the id's desires and the superego's constraints. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    Similarly, the Parks' superego is not without its flaws. For instance, Mr. Park comments on the Kims’ smell, saying, “That stench is coming from somewhere” (Parasite 1:27:13–1:27:16). While this might seem like an innocent observation, it underscores their perceived moral and social superiority, further emphasizing the divide between the two families. This instance subtly reinforces the Parks’ reliance on societal norms to maintain their privileged status, while also exposing their condescension toward those they see as beneath them.

                <h2>Jaws Analysis</h2>

                    <p>
                        Jaws is well known for its terrifying shark, captivating characters, and infamous hunt, but at its core, the film highlights the conflict between economic benefit and human safety. The small town of Amity Island becomes a destination of a capitalist society, where the town's leadership prioritizes profits over public safety. This is most evident in Mayor Vaughn when Chief Brody shuts down the beaches until the shark is caught, and Mayor Vaughn briefly yells, “Only 24 hours!” (Jaws 20:18–20:19). Vaughn insists on keeping the beaches open despite the shark attacks, fearing that closing them would harm the town's lucrative tourist economy. He also in this same scene places a 3000$ bounty on the shark as a way of making the working class do his job for him through the use of money. His actions represent the bourgeoisie in Marxist theory and demonstrate the prioritization of capital over the well-being of the working class and community. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The proletariat is represented by the tourists and Chief Brody. Brody symbolizes the working-class hero who rebels against the greedy bourgeoisie. The shark in this system acts as a threat to the bourgeoisie and their status quo. This threat is resolved by the group of three Quint, Brody, and Hooper offering a metaphor for how the working class must confront their problems while the bourgeoisie neglect theirs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, Quint shares a haunting story with Brody and Hooper about his time aboard the USS Indianapolis, illustrating his experience as a victim of the exploitative system between the ruling class and the working class. He explains how “They didn’t even list us as overdue for a week” (Jaws 1:30:32–1:30:34), helping the audience understand his disdain for those in power. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Psychoanalytical Lens</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through the lens of psychoanalysis, we can uncover how jaws represents the id, ego, and superego—the three forces driving our mental struggles.
                    </p>
    
                    </p>
                    In Jaws, the shark embodies the id in its purest form. It is an unstoppable force of nature, driven only by its primal need to hunt and consume. The shark isn’t capable of negotiating or conscious of its actions; it acts on pure instinct, reflecting humanity’s deepest, most basic desires.  
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    In the scene, Hooper tries to convince the mayor to close the beach due to the dangers of the shark, he explained how ruthless the shark is, saying “All this machine does is swim, eat, and make little sharks.” (Jaws 52:36 – 52:43) Hooper’s description captures the id perfectly. The shark’s singular purpose is survival, echoing Freud’s idea that the id is entirely unconscious and focused on immediate gratification. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    Chief Brody represents the ego. His role as the town’s police chief places him squarely in the middle of conflicting demands. On one side, there’s the shark—a life-threatening embodiment of the id. On the other, there’s Mayor Vaughn and the town’s economic interests, which can be seen as a distorted version of the superego. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    While Hooper and chief Brody are discussing on hoopers boat as they were looking for another shark, the topic of why chief Brody works on an island came up due to Hoopers curiosity since chief Brody expressed his fear for large bodies of water, chief Brody explained his reasoning saying “It’s only an island if you look at it from the water." (Jaws 46:35 – 46:38) Brody’s internal conflict mirrors the ego’s struggle to balance impulses and moral reasoning. He wants to close the beaches to protect the townspeople, but societal and economic pressures force him to compromise, showing the ego’s delicate act of mediation. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    Mayor Vaughn represents the superego—or rather, a flawed version of it. The superego is meant to uphold morality and societal values, but Vaughn’s concern for the town’s reputation and economy blinds him to the immediate danger.  
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    In the scene on the boat, the mayor explains to chief Brody why he can’t close the beach without proper jurisdiction and how the beach must stay open for the island to make money, saying “Amity is a summer town. We need summer dollars.” (Jaws 12:26 – 12-33) Here, Vaughn’s actions show how a misguided superego can prioritize social constructs—like financial stability and public image—over ethical responsibility. His refusal to act puts lives at risk, demonstrating how societal pressures can skew moral judgment. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    On the other hand, Matt Hooper, the marine biologist, represents the superego’s scientific and ethical side. His expertise and logical reasoning guide his decisions. Hooper’s desire to protect the public and study the shark aligns with the superego’s idealized vision of what’s right. While Hooper is arguing with the mayor about why he must close the beach for the safety of the people, Hooper in a fit of frustration comments on the mayor's stubbornness yelling “You’re gonna ignore this problem until it swims up and bites you on the ass!” (Jaws 51:48 - 51:54) Hooper’s frustration with Vaughn underscores the tension between ethical responsibility and societal pressure. He is the voice of reason, urging action to prevent further harm. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    The final scene of Jaws serves as a resolution to these psychoanalytic conflicts. As Brody, Hooper, and Quint start their hunt to kill the shark, they unite the id, ego, and superego in a singular mission. Quint, the rugged fisherman, operates on instinct and raw experience, much like the id. Hooper’s scientific approach reflects the superego, while Brody’s leadership ties them together as the ego. While searching for the great white shark, chief Brody is throwing blood and meat into the water, the shark shockingly appeared, which frightened chief Brody causing him to slowly walk backwards towards Quint, expressing his fear saying "You're gonna need a bigger boat." (Jaws 1:21:26 - 1:21:29) This line underscores the challenge the characters had to face, highlighting the need of them coming together to unify their efforts, representing the balancing between the id, ego, and superego. Although Quint’s personality and actions directly contrast Hooper’s calculated methods, both are essential to the mission. Brody’s ability to manage both of them and defeat the shark symbolizes the ego’s success in balancing the conflicting sides of the mind.

                    <h2>Marxist Lens</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through a Marxist lens, the very premise of the show is the idea that contestants are competing against each other to obtain financial salvation. The premise of the show is used as a critique against the downsides of capitalism.  The contestants are proletariat, and the game masters and VIPs are the bourgeoise, who exploit the contestants for entertainment. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parasite and Squid Game both critique capitalism, although their approaches are different. While Parasite subtly displays class dynamics through interpersonal relationships, Squid Game applies overt violence to portray systemic oppression. For example, the Parks disdain for the lower class is reflected with the way the VIPs treat the contestants. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Jaws indirectly critiques capitalist greed, the mayor's insistence on keeping the beaches open despite the recent shark attacks reflects the prioritization of profit over public safety, a similar theme that is consistent in Squid Game.

                    <h2>Psychoanalytical Lens</h2>
                    <p>
                        Looking through a psychoanalytical lens, let’s breakdown the show using Sigmund’s Structure. The id, which is the primitive desires and instincts, is seen in the initial reactions of the participants to the games. Their desperation for money and survival makes them act impulsively, often forgetting their own morality. In episode 6 titled “Gganbu”, Sang-woo, a contestant in the games, betrays one of his friends, Ali, in a marble game where you are forced to play against your teammate. In this challenge, both teammates must play a game of their choosing that utilize marbles. The person who collects the other person’s marbles, wins, while the loser, dies. Sang-woo’s actions represents his desperation to win, even at the expense of others. He gains Ali's trust by saying, “there's a way that both of us could live” (Squid Game 00:30:14-00:30:16), only to steal Ali's marbles and secure his own safety. His actions were controlled by his id. He put his self-interests over his moral compass.
                    </p>
    
                    </p>
                    Gi-hun is the perfect representation of the ego. He is torn between his instinctual desire to survive and his moral compass. In the final game, Gi-hun hesitates when facing against Sang-woo. Gi-hun tries to listen to his moral compass while navigating the games’ brutality. 
                    <p>
    
                    </p>
                    The contestants’ morality embodies the superego. In the episode “Gganbu”, Gi-hun’s teammate in the marble game is Il-nam, an elderly contestant. Gi-hun is stricken with guilt when he forced to play against Il-nam to win the game. His feelings of guilt contrasts with Sang-woo’s desire to win just like how the superego contrasts the id.

                    Like Parasite and Jaws, the representation of ego is the protagonist. The protagonist is usually seen to be the most relatable character as most people juggle between their id and superego on a daily basis.

                    When it comes to the representations of the id. This is where Parasite contrasts with Squid Game. Mr. Kim’s actions are derived from built up emotions while Sang-woo’s actions are derived from greed and survival.

                    <h2>Camera Angles</h2>
                    <p>
                        The camera angles in Squid Game frequently cut between wide shots and close-ups to emphasize the size of the arena where the game is held and to isolate the characters psychologically. For example, a bird's-eye view of the players in the "Red Light, Green Light" game highlight their insignificance, while close-up shots display their terror as they realize that their lives are on the line. This is similar to Parasite, where the film uses verticality to portray class inequality. The wealthy Park family lives in a mansion perched on top of a hill, while the poor Kim family lives in a semi-basement and is always looking up. In Jaws, the camera angles often utilize underwater POVs, placing the viewer in the shark's point of view to build suspense and fear.

                    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, Parasite, Jaws, and even Squid Game teach us how to use storytelling to critique our economic and social structure. With psychoanalytical theory, we can understand how the characters affect the story and how their decisions build towards the main narrative. Through a Marxist lens, we were able understand the underlying messages and the artistic vision behind each show or film. To end on a personal note, I enjoy breaking down and examining shows from different backgrounds and how they can relate to certain themes or ideas.
